Task: Create a player dash with animation of player slightly shaded down behind

Pseudocode:

//variables
Player player;
Sprite playerShadedDown;
int dashAmount;
int currentDash;

void PlayerDash
{
    if (player.direction == (-1,0)) //if player is facing the right side
    {
        while currentDash < dashAmount
        {
            player.location += (-1,0);
            LoadSprite(playerShadedDown,player.location(0,0));
            currentDash++;
        }
        for (i = dashAmount; i > 0; i--)
        {
            DeleteSprite(playerShadedDown,player.location(-i,0));
        }
    }
}

// Do the same for the rest of the directions

Improve for actual code:
- Could make more efficient by using variables instead for example storing the direction the player is already facing
 instead of using player.direction == (-1,0) so it can fit in one if statement
- improve the way the sprite is loaded and need more spirte animations as in video it gets more shaded the further it is
- delete sprites during the dash as the shaded sprites dont cover the entire dash
- fix variables based on how I need to for OTClient.
